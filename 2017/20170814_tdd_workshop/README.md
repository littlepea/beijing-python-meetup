# TDD pair programming workshop (2017-08-14)

In this workshop we'll learn about TDD and pair programming in a very hands-on and interactive way.

For each exercise, we'll start with a simple code Kata what we will implement using TDD.

In each pair we'll have one driver who will type the code in 
and one navigator who will navigate him or her during the implementation.

Eventually, we'll try different formats, 
such as "ping pong" where we swap the driver and navigator after each new test.

## Code Katas

* [Tennis Game](tennis.py) + [solution](solutions/tennis.py)
* [Library Late Fees](library.py) + [solution](solutions/library.py)
* [FizzBuzzWhiz](fizzbuzzwhiz.py) + [solution](solutions/fizzbuzzwhiz.py)
