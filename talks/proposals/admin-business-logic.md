# Separating Administrative and Business Logic in Python

## Talk Description

* Title: Separating Administrative and Business Logic in Python
* Duration: 1 hour
* Level: Intermediate
* Presenter: [Evgeny Demchenko](https://twitter.com/littlepea12)

## Summary

Even a very simple Python application will probably have a few different type of logic in it:
 
* Business/domain logic
* Administrative logic (I/O, caching, making requests)
* Interface logic (Handling user input, displaying output)
* Application logic (Use cases)

It's very easy to put all this code together in one place, at the end of the day, 
what matters is that your application works the way you expect it to work.
But as it grows, it's important to separate different types of logic 
so that the code is easier to maintain, understand and test. 
 
This is an Intermediate level talk but both beginners and advanced developers will find something new or useful here too.
