## Q&A

### How to submit a talk proposal?

1. Fork this repository
2. Add a markdown file to [proposals directory](proposals/) with your talk description
3. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/littlepea/beijing-python-meetup/pulls)

Once a proposal is accepted we'll schedule the presentation for one of the upcoming meetups.

### How long should a talk be?

The short answer: no more than 1 hour.

Longer answer: 5, 10, 30 or 60 minutes.

5-10 minutes talks can be done during a "Lightning talks" session combines with other short talks.
Lightning talks are a good opportunity for first-time presenters to try to give a talk, 
it's a no pressure situation, easy to prepare, quick to present and the worst thing that might happen - 
people will be bored for a few minutes. ðŸ˜„

30-60 minutes talks require more preparation and usually end with a Q&A session.
